## Introduction
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for 2 challenging tasks: binary classification of benign and malignant skin lesions and three classes classification of Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

## Dataset
The dataset includes dermoscopic images in JPEG format with a distribution that reflects real-world settings, where benign cases outnumber malignant ones but with an overrepresentation of malignancies. The images come from:   
- HAM10000 Dataset (ViDIR Group, Medical University of Vienna)
- BCN_20000 Dataset (Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona)
- MSK Dataset (ISBI 2017)  

The dataset consists of more than 15,000 images for binary classification and around 6,000 images for three classes classification. Data Distribution of two and three classes classification is shown below:
